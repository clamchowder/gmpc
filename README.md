# GHPC Missions Mod

## Features
Built off Andrix's mod at https://github.com/Andrix44/GunnerModPC but adds a few more things:
- A lot of inactive vehicles on the Grafenwoehr tank range for better rangefinding practice. Several other vehicles have been added too with different ammo loadouts
- The Replen Reaper, Kinetic Key, Reservist Recon, and Claustrophobia missions have been modified. I'll leave the spoilers out of the readme. 

## Installation
- Install MelonLoader v0.6.1: https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader.
- Copy `GHPCMissionsMod.dll` to `\Gunner, HEAT, PC!\Bin\Mods`.

## Building
You can simply build the project with Visual Studio, but first you have to fix the references so that they point to your game DLLs.
